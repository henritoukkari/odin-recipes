    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato, quartered</li>
        <li>1-inch knob of ginger, peeled and cut into pieces</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves (3 whole, 2 finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 green chili (Thai green chilies work well)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, medium diced</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>¼ tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>¼ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 tbsp heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup paneer cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes (or more, to preference)</li>
        <li>½ tbsp fenugreek leaves, crushed</li>
        <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring salted water to a boil in a medium pot. Blanch the spinach leaves for 2 minutes, until leaves are bright green. Remove immediately and dunk in cold water; drain well. (You can also use frozen spinach; pop in the microwave in a bowl with a bit of water before using.)</li>
        <li>Combine with tomato, ginger, the whole cloves of garlic, and chili in a food processor. Purée until a fine, wet paste forms.</li>
        <li>Melt ghee in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the chopped garlic, and sauté until beginning to brown, and then add the onions. Season with salt and pepper, and cook until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach mixture and water to the pan. Stir to combine, and season to taste. Lower stovetop to medium heat and cover, stirring occasionally, for about 6-8 minutes, or until thickened to preference. If it becomes too thick, adjust with more water.</li>
        <li>When you have achieved desired consistency, add garam masala, turmeric, cayenne, and coriander, and stir to combine. Season to taste.</li>
        <li>Lower heat and add heavy cream and paneer. Simmer for a few minutes, until paneer is warmed through.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Add lemon juice, fenugreek leaves, and stir to combine. Season with salt if desired. Serve hot with basmati rice or naan bread.</li>
    </ol>
